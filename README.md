# rqtl2_to_bimbam 

This is a Python program designed and written to convert `genotype files` and `phenotype files` from [Rqtl2 format](https://kbroman.org/qtl2/assets/vignettes/input_files.html) to [BIMBAM format](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/blob/master/doc/manual.pdf). These file formats are popular in most GeneNetwork analyses.
